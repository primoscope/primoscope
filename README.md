## üöÄ Overview

**primoscope** is a forward-thinking project that transforms any GitHub repository into an intelligent, self-monitoring, and collaborative development hub. By integrating deeply with GitHub Monitor and Copilot Spaces, primoscope provides:

- Real-time insights into repository health and activity
- AI-assisted, cloud-based development environments
- Automated workflows to reduce manual overhead
- An extensible architecture for custom integrations

This repository serves both as a template and a live demo of building an AI-powered, transparent, and high-velocity GitHub workflow.
