## üöÄ Overview

**primoscope** is a forward-thinking project designed to create an intelligent, self-monitoring, and collaborative development ecosystem. By deeply integrating with GitHub's most powerful features like **GitHub Monitor** and **Copilot Spaces**, primoscope transforms a standard repository into a dynamic project management and development hub.

This project serves as both a template and a live demonstration of how to build a highly efficient, transparent, and AI-assisted workflow on GitHub.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A GitHub account with administrative access to a repository.
- Basic familiarity with GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, and Actions.

### 1. GitHub Monitor Integration

GitHub Monitor is key to proactive project health tracking.

1.  **Install the App:**
    - Visit the [**GitHub Monitor**](https://github.com/marketplace/github-monitor) page on the Marketplace.
    - Click `Install` and authorize it for your `primoscope/primoscope` repository.

2.  **Configure Notifications:**
    - In the Monitor dashboard, select the events you want to track (e.g., new issues, stale PRs, release drafts).
    - Connect your preferred notification channels (Slack, Email, or a custom Webhook) for real-time alerts.

3.  **Verify:**
    - Create a test issue or PR to confirm that you receive a notification, and the activity appears in the Monitor dashboard.

### 2. Copilot Spaces (RGC) Integration

Use Copilot Spaces for a powerful, collaborative development experience.

1.  **Create a Space:**
    - Navigate to [**GitHub Copilot Spaces**](https://github.com/features/copilot-spaces).
    - Initiate a new Space and link it to this repository (`primoscope/primoscope`).

2.  **Configure the Environment:**
    - Inside the Space settings, ensure RGC (Remote GitHub Collaboration) is enabled.
    - Customize the dev container configuration (`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`) if needed to standardize the environment for all collaborators.

3.  **Collaborate:**
    - Invite team members to the Space.
    - Start a coding session to experience real-time, AI-assisted pair programming and prototyping.

## üìã Usage

-   **As a Project Manager:** Use the **GitHub Monitor** dashboard to get a high-level overview of project velocity, identify bottlenecks in the PR queue, and track issue resolution times.
-   **As a Developer:** Spin up a **Copilot Space** from any issue or pull request to get a fully configured, ready-to-code environment. Collaborate with peers and leverage Copilot to write better code, faster.
-   **As a Contributor:** Refer to our contribution guidelines, pick an open issue, and submit a pull request. Our automated workflows will handle the rest.
